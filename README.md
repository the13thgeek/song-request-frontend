# song-request-frontend
Song Request system for OBS (Browser Source frontend)

This will be the front-end display for the song-request system for @the13thgeek.

- The frontend will display a horizontal queue of request songs, displayed by song title/artist and the name of the user who requested.
- Websockets will be implemented as song requests/commands will be coming through Firebot which will send HTTP requests through a separate NodeJS app (WIP).
